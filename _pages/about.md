I am Hasith Perera(KE8TJE), a physicist who discovered amateur radio as both a fun hobby and a powerful tool with practical applications. I earned my Techncian lisence in February 2021 while attending a Tech-in-a-Day session at Morgantown WV conducted by the amateur radio club of West Virginia University W8CUL.

Today, I enjoy QRP operations, SSB and older digital modes like RTTY/PSK31. You might still catch me occationally on FT8 or JS8 Call as well. (At some point I would like to be proficient in CW as it is the ultimate QRP mode. figures crossed)

I'm a strong believer in open-source software and using radio as a platform for science exploration. With a background in plasma physics and electronics, I enjoy working on DIY projects that solves interesting problems I encounter but also provide a learning opportunity to explore more of the hobby.

This website serves primarily as a personal technical log and documentation archive. If you have questions about anything you find here, feel free to reach out — I’m always happy to discuss ideas, projects, and radio science.
